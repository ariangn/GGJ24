Chuckletown is a fast-paced game about loosening people up through alcohol and making them laugh. You play as Cosmo, the former-quarterback bartender at a comedy club who must mix drinks to fulfill patrons’ orders and throw them across the room to patrons. The more the crowd drinks, the more they will laugh: your comedian friend Jambo will appreciate it. <br>

#### Patrons:

Patrons will start to steadily filter in over the course of the night. By hovering over a patron, you can see their mood, and the ingredients for the drink they want. Patrons who receive the drinks they want will steadily increase in mood.

#### Mixing:

In the mixing area on the bottom right, select any two ingredients from the following: vodka, whisky, seltzer, and juice. Then choose a glass, and press the “mix” button to create a new drink. A beer glass is easiest to aim but will take a while to take effect. A martini glass makes aiming harder but will make your patrons happier faster, and a syringe, while very difficult to aim, will make patrons blissful instantly.

#### Throwing:

Once you have mixed a drink, click on a patron to begin aiming your shot. An aiming reticle will start rotating constantly: you must time your shot by clicking when this reticle is lined up with the dotted line to get the perfect angle. If the correct drink reaches your patron, their mood will begin to increase.

#### Winning and Losing:

The overall mood of the crowd is indicated by the “laugh meter” in the upper left corner. Happy patrons will contribute to the rise of the meter, while upset patrons contribute to its fall. If you max out the meter, you will win the game! But if the meter drops to zero, it is game over.
